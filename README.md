# SwarmAI
This is a project for the 2019-2020 ATOS challenge on Collaborative AI. Our submission was based on creating agents which are able to collaborate with each other to search a building. The use case was of buildings in a natural disaster where traditonal infrastructure could be down so a local solution is needed.

* A soultion was porduced using reinforcement learning.
* Using Unity Engien as a testing and training enviroment to create AI.
* Mulitple different AI was created to find the best possible network configuration.

## Process
1. We decided on the use case and came up with an idea.
2. Created testing enviroments for the training simulation in Unity Game Engine.
3. Intially used singular Agents to see if they could successfully navigate to every square in a maze.
4. Built more complex mazes and started to add more agents into the mix.
5. All the coding for the project was done in C# using the ML Agents Plugin. 

## Tools used
